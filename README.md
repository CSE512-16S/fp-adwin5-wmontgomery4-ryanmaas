Interactive Learning for Hierarchy of Concepts
===============
## Goal
We aim to buid a visualization system for a crowdsourcing algorithm which learns hierarchies of concepts. Our focus are:

1. Besides MAP tree, find the best way to visualize the hidden edge and possible parent for each node. 
2. Animate the transition before and after the user select the answer. Good animzation helps the user to track the change.
3. Observe if the visualization tool will improve accuracy rate and speed up the process on crowdsourcing.

## Abstract
This is brief introduction of our visualization system.
<ol type="A">
  <li>Color encoding for the strength of edge between parent and their children.</li>
  <li>Visualize the hidden edges and possible parent when cursor hovers over the node.</li>
  <li>Interactive Interface to ask, collect and render the tree based on the user's answer. Then throws out the most informative question for next iteration.</li>
</ol>
