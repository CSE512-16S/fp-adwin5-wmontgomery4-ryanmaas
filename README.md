Interactive Learning for Hierarchy of Concepts
===============
## Goal
We aimed to build a visualization system for a crowdsourcing algorithm which learns hierarchies of concepts. Our focuses were on how to visualize the uncertainty in the distribution over hierarchies, and teach users how the algorithm learns from answering questions.
